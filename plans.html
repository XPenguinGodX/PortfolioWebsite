    <h1>Future Plans</h1>
    <h2>Where I'm Headed</h2>
    <p>After I graduate, I plan to pursue a career in software engineering, hopefully working with cutting-edge
      technologies that contribute to space exploration and scientific discovery. One of my biggest goals is to work at
      NASA and help develop the systems that support future space missions.</p>
    <p>Even if we are alone on the universe it would still be cool to explore and see what this universe has to offer
    </p>
    <p>Elements we havent discovered yet, Colors no one has seen, and hopefully life.</p>
