    <h1>Future Plans</h1>
    <h2>Where I'm Headed</h2>
    <p>After I graduate, I plan to pursue a career in software engineering, hopefully working with cutting-edge
      technologies that contribute to space exploration and scientific discovery. One of my biggest goals is to work at
      NASA and help develop the systems that support future space missions.</p>
    <p>Even if we are alone on the universe it would still be cool to explore and see what this universe has to offer
    </p>
    <p>Elements we havent discovered yet, Colors no one has seen, and hopefully life.</p>

    <h2>Inspirational Quotes</h2>
    <p>Here are some quotes that inspire me as I work towards my goals:</p>


    <blockquote>
      "I gotta thank God cause he gave me the strength to rock HARD "
      <br>— LL COOL J
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      "Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars."
      <br>— Norman Vincent Peale
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      "your soul is in your keeping alone. When you stand before God, you cannot say, "But I was told by others to do
      thus." Or that, "Virtue was not convenient at the time.""
      <br>— King Baldwin IV in Kingdom of Heaven
    </blockquote>
